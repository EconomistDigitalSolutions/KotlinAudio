KotlinAudio is an Android audio player written in Kotlin, making it simpler to work with audio playback from streams and files.

Inspired by [SwiftAudio.](https://github.com/DoubleSymmetry/SwiftAudioEx) Our aim is to have feature parity with the iOS equivalent.

Currently a work in progress! More information soon.

EDIT:: This is a forked repo and is used to expose ExoPlayer from React Native Track Player. See: [b232027d445b5f8ad71b661946f1dad1566d3a35](https://github.com/EconomistDigitalSolutions/mobile-darwin/pull/632/commits/b232027d445b5f8ad71b661946f1dad1566d3a35)
