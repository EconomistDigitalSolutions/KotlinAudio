# KotlinAudio

The repo that supports the submodule which is a fork of the original [KotlinAudio](https://github.com/doublesymmetry/KotlinAudio) but allows us to use reflection to integrate Conviva.

We needed a way to attach the Conviva SDK to ExoPlayer and then secondly expose methods to allow us to update the playback with metadata from React Native.
